# BBC News Classification using NLP

This code is designed to classify BBC News headlines into one of five categories (business, politics, entertainment, sports, tech) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- NLTK library

## Installation

To install the required libraries, use the following commands:

```python
pip install pandas
pip install nltk
```

After installing the required libraries, download the BBC News dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hgultekin/bbcnewsarchive?resource=download) and save it in the same directory as the code.

## Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code and the dataset.

2. Run the following command to preprocess the dataset:

```python
python preprocess.py
```

3. Run the following command to classify the headlines:

```python
python classify.py
```

The code will output the category of each headline along with the actual category and the accuracy of the classification.
